**Hi, I'm Janno ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a Software developer based in Philippines. I have over 4 years of experience in Software development. I developed backend solutions and frontend/mobile applications for companies and startups to make their idea into a solid business.

If I'm not coding, I'm likely playing board games (mostly social deduction type of board/card games :wink:) or playing video games.
